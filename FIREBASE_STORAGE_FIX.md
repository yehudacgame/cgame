# Firebase Storage Setup Fix & Alternatives

## Common Storage Setup Issues

### Issue: "Unknown Error" when enabling Storage

This is a known Firebase Console issue. Here are several solutions:

## Solution 1: Try Different Browser/Incognito Mode

1. Open **Incognito/Private browsing window**
2. Sign in to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
3. Navigate to your project → **Storage**
4. Try enabling Storage again

## Solution 2: Use Firebase CLI

Install Firebase CLI and enable Storage via command line:

```bash
# Install Firebase CLI
npm install -g firebase-tools

# Login to Firebase
firebase login

# Initialize in your project directory
cd /Users/yehudaelmaliach/CGame
firebase init storage

# Select your project and region
# This will create firebase.json and storage.rules files
```

## Solution 3: Enable via Google Cloud Console

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Select your Firebase project
3. Navigate to **Storage** → **Browser**
4. Click **Create Bucket**
5. Name: `[your-project-id].appspot.com`
6. Location: Same as Firestore
7. Storage class: Standard
8. Access control: Uniform

## Solution 4: Manual Storage Rules Setup

If Storage appears enabled but rules aren't set:

1. Firebase Console → **Storage** → **Rules** tab
2. Replace with these rules:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    // Allow users to read/write their own clips
    match /clips/{userId}/{allPaths=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
    
    // Allow users to read/write their own thumbnails
    match /thumbnails/{userId}/{allPaths=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
  }
}
```

3. Click **Publish**

## Alternative: Run App Without Storage (Local-Only Mode)

While you fix Storage setup, the app can work with local storage only:

### Quick Fix - Disable Cloud Upload

Edit `CGame/CGame/ViewModels/ClipsViewModel.swift`:

Find this section (around line 253-257):
```swift
// Auto-upload to cloud if user is authenticated and not anonymous
if let currentUser = Auth.auth().currentUser,
   currentUser.email != "anonymous@cgame.local" {
    await uploadNewClipsToCloud(sessionInfo: sessionInfo)
}
```

Comment it out temporarily:
```swift
// Auto-upload to cloud if user is authenticated and not anonymous
// Temporarily disabled while Storage setup is pending
// if let currentUser = Auth.auth().currentUser,
//    currentUser.email != "anonymous@cgame.local" {
//     await uploadNewClipsToCloud(sessionInfo: sessionInfo)
// }
```

### Disable Storage Service Calls

Create a feature flag in `CGame/CGame/Services/StorageService.swift`:

Add at the top of the class:
```swift
class StorageService {
    static let shared = StorageService()
    private let storage = Storage.storage()
    
    // TEMPORARY: Disable storage while setup is pending
    private let STORAGE_ENABLED = false
    
    private init() {}
```

Then update upload methods:
```swift
func uploadClip(...) async throws -> String {
    guard STORAGE_ENABLED else {
        // Return fake URL for local testing
        return "local://\(clipId).mp4"
    }
    // ... rest of implementation
}
```

## Verification Steps

Once Storage is enabled, verify it's working:

1. **Check Firebase Console**:
   - Storage should show "Get started" as completed
   - Rules tab should be accessible
   - Files tab should show empty bucket

2. **Check in Code**:
   ```swift
   // Test Storage access in your app
   let storage = Storage.storage()
   let storageRef = storage.reference()
   print("Storage bucket: \(storageRef.bucket)")
   ```

3. **Test Upload**:
   - Sign in to the app
   - Record a clip
   - Check Firebase Console → Storage → Files
   - Should see: `/clips/[userId]/[clipId].mp4`

## Common Error Messages & Fixes

### "Permission Denied"
- Check Storage rules are published
- Verify user is authenticated
- Check bucket name matches project

### "Bucket doesn't exist"
- Storage not properly initialized
- Try Solution 3 (Google Cloud Console)

### "Invalid bucket name"
- Bucket name must be `[project-id].appspot.com`
- Don't use custom bucket names initially

## Working Without Cloud Storage

The app is designed to work perfectly with local storage:

### Features Available:
✅ Kill detection and recording
✅ Local clip storage
✅ Clip playback
✅ Authentication (without cloud sync)
✅ Gaming profiles
✅ User stats (local)

### Features Requiring Storage:
❌ Cloud backup of clips
❌ Cross-device sync
❌ Sharing clips online
❌ Storage quotas

## Support Checklist

If still having issues:

1. **Project Settings**:
   - Default GCP resource location is set
   - Billing account (not required for free tier)
   - Firebase project is on Blaze plan (optional)

2. **Browser Issues**:
   - Clear cache and cookies
   - Try different browser
   - Disable ad blockers

3. **Account Issues**:
   - Check you're project owner
   - Try with different Google account
   - Check organization policies

4. **Region Issues**:
   - Some regions have restrictions
   - Try us-central1 if having issues

## Next Steps

1. Try solutions in order (1-3)
2. If Storage still won't enable, use local-only mode
3. Contact Firebase Support if persistent
4. The app will work great even without cloud storage!

Remember: The core functionality (kill detection, recording, local clips) works perfectly without Firebase Storage. Cloud sync is a bonus feature!
